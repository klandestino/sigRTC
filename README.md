# sigRTC - Decentralized WebRTC Signaling

This is an effort to make WebRTC yet more peer-to-peer.

sigRTC is a WebRTC signaling server, which will connect to other sigRTC servers, enabling WebRTC clients at different servers to connect to each other. It will use DHT (Distributed Hash Table) to find the other sigRTC servers, so we do not need any central server or tracker for WebRTC anymore, just a swarm of decentralized/autonomous signaling servers connecting to each other.

We like to see it as the WebRTC clients just outsourcing the DHT tracking to the server side.
